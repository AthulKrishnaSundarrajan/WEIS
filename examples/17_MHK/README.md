In this example, we have several configurations of a MHK simulation and optimization in WEIS

# WEIS Drivers


# Geometry inputs
All start with RM1_*.yaml
- RM1_noPB.yaml stands for no permanent ballast
- RM1_big_rotor.yaml has a larger rotor
- RM1_big_gen.yaml has a larger generator
- RM1_big_both.yaml both are larger
 
# Modeling inputs


# Analysis inputs
